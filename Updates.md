# Updates
This is a full list of all the updates/releases for IXHell.

---
## VERSION 0.3 [pre-release]
I added a very bad, off brand copy of Smart Score. I'm probably going to have to change the name "Smart Score" to something else so IXL doesn't sue me.

### FEATURES
 - Crappy version of Smart Score

---
## VERSION 0.2 [pre-release]
This version is the same as version 1, but there's styles for the main lesson and a questions answered counter.

### FEATURES
 - Questions answered
 - Styles
 
 Bedsides that, there's not much of a difference from version 0.1

---
## VERSION 0.1 [pre-release]
This is the first version of the program to be released. It is pretty bad and ther will be a lot of work between this version and the next one.
### FEATURES:
 - Impossible to beat
 - There is only one lesson *(Level A - A.1: Your worst nightmare)*
 - There is only addition in the lesson, and barley any styling
